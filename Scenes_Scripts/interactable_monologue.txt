// ## Bed text
[center]I should take a look around before I rest again.[/center]


// ## Ceiling Fan text
[center]This thing looks like a fan, but it is not connected to any machinery.[/center]
[center]I do not understand this object's purpose.[/center]


// ## Small fan text
[center]This object seems to be a smaller version of the object in the bedroom.[/center]

[center]This revelation brings me no closer to grasping its purpose.[/center]


// ## Stove text
[center]Nothing happens when I attempt to turn it on.[/center]

[center]Perhaps its power source is missing.[/center]


// ## Stool text
[center]This item's purpose seems to be similiar to that of the [i]bed[/i],[/center]
[center]providing neccessary rest to one's framework.[/center]

[center]But it performs worse in every conceivable way.[/center]
[center]Its existence is puzzling.[/center]


// ## Kitchen Sink text
[center]This object's shape suggests that it is a reservoir,[/center]
[center]but I lack knowledge on what substance it may contain.[/center]


// ## Fridge text
[center]The temparature inside of this object is lower than that of its surroundings.[/center]

[center]It must have been used to store power cores and other fragile components.[/center]


// ## Door text
[center]This place is safe enough, I should not wander.[/center]
[center]At least until [b]It[/b] follows me here.[/center]


// ## Bathroom blocade text
[center]This structure's previous residents barricaded most of the doors and windows, except for the lift in the corridor.[/center]
[center]We may only theorize on the cause for this behaviour.[/center]


// ## TV text
[center]A primitive broadcast receiver.[/center]
[center]It seems that no one is transmitting anything this far out from The Core.[/center]

[center]...but all the infrastructure should still be intact. Perplexing.[/center]


// ## Radio text
[center]I waited for too long.[/center]
[center][b]It[/b] is here.[/center]

[center]I should leave this place while I still can.[/center]


// ## Lift text
[center]I am safe here. These walls should limit [b]its[/b] influence.[/center]

[center]If I measured everything correctly, this ride to the bottom will take appoximately 313 hours.[/center]
