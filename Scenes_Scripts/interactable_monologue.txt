// ## Bed
[center]I should take a look around before I rest again.[/center]


// ## Ceiling Fan
[center]I do not understand this object's purpose.[/center]
[center]Its movement does not accomplish any task that I can recognise.[/center]


// ## Small fan
[center]This object seems to be a smaller version of the object in the bedroom.[/center]

[center]This revelation brings me no closer to figuring out its purpose.[/center]


// ## Stove
[center]Nothing happened.[/center]

[center]Perhaps its power source is missing.[/center]


// ## Stool
[center]This item's purpose seems to be similiar to that of the [i]bed[/i],[/center]
[center]providing neccessary rest to one's subsystems.[/center]

[center]But it performs worse in every conceivable way.[/center]
[center]Its existence is puzzling.[/center]


// ## Kitchen Sink
[center]Nothing happened.[/center]

[center]This object's shape suggests that it is a reservoir,[/center]
[center]but I have no knowledge of what substance it contains.[/center]


// ## Fridge
[center]Temparature inside of this object is lower than that of its surroundings.[/center]

[center]It must have been used to store power cores and other fragile components.[/center]


// ## Door text
[center]This place is safe enough, I should not wander.[/center]
[center]At least until [i]it[/i] gets here.[/center]


// ## TV text
[center]A primitive broadcast receiver.[/center]
[center]No one is broadcasting anything [i]this[/i] far out from the center.[/center]

[center]...but all the infrastructure should still be intact.[/center]


// ## Radio text
[center]I waited for too long.[/center]

[center][b]It[/b] is here.[/center]

[center]I should get out of here while I still can.[/center]
